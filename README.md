# Analog-IC-Design

## Summary
This report presents the design, analysis, and understanding of various analog integrated circuits. The technology library used is UMC_18_CMOS, based on 180nm CMOS technology. All circuit designs, simulations, and evaluations were carried out using Cadence Virtuoso.

During the internship, the theoretical concepts of different analog circuits were thoroughly studied. For each circuit, certain specifications were provided. Based on these specifications, relevant theoretical equations and concepts were applied to calculate the necessary transistor sizing (W/L ratios) and bias voltages.

Following the calculations, each circuit was implemented using the Cadence Virtuoso Schematic Editor. A variety of simulations—such as DC, AC, and transient analyses—were performed to evaluate the circuit’s performance and compare the results with the initial design specifications.

In cases where simulated results deviated from the target specifications, a tuning process was carried out. This involved modifying certain circuit parameters based on theoretical insights, observed waveforms, and target specifications. The goal of this tuning process was to minimize the gap between simulated and specified values.

Overall, this internship provided valuable hands-on experience with the complete analog IC design flow—from specification and calculation to schematic entry, simulation, and performance tuning.
